I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree with the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](http://eie.bjtu.edu.cn/), Beijing Jiaotong University, China, since Sep/2022. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [***Jiayi Zhang***](https://sites.google.com/site/jiayizhang8650/). Sponsored by CSC, I am co-supervised by ***IEEE Fellow*** Prof. [***Arumugam Nallanathan***](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~nalla/) from Jan. 2025 to Jan. 2026.

My research primarily focuses on next-generation MIMO technology, including **extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO)** and **cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO)**. Our key objective is to explore <font color="#C93756">"performance analysis and efficient design for next-generation MIMO systems"</font>. If you are interested in our work, you can refer to this [repository](https://github.com/BJTU-MIMO) and WeChat official account (ID: BJTU MIMO) for the latest updates of our group!

If you have any questions or have an interest in collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me (zhilongliu@bjtu.edu.cn)!
